          Programming languages all have built-in data structures, but these
          often differ from one language to another. This article attempts to
          list the built-in data structures available in JavaScript and what
          properties they have. These can be used to build other data
          structures. Wherever possible, comparisons with other languages are
          drawn.
          <br /> <br /> Dynamic typing JavaScript is a loosely typed and dynamic
          language. Variables in JavaScript are not directly associated with any
          particular value type, and any variable can be assigned (and
          re-assigned) values of all types:
        </p>
      </PostContentContainer>
    </section>
  );
}
